                <p>I am a Memphis-born, Cleveland-raised aspiring full stack developer. Growing up in Cleveland Heights, I attended school through the CHUH school system. I am the youngest of 5, which includes my two half brothers.
                I've always gravitated to technology since I was a child, the biggest medium being video games. Naturally, like any respectable gamer, I've dreamed of making my own game for a long time now. This is a passion project that I hope to complete, but coding has opened my eyes to the world of possibilities available to me.
                </p>
    
            
                <p>I'm fond of camping, traveling, and cinema as well. This year I've already been on 5 trips, the latest in New Orleans! 
                    Working hard means you need to play hard too, right? I just happened to front-load my fun before the work. Even so, I hope to take at least one more trip, to see my sisters in California. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Within this course, I'm hoping I will get a foundation to build upon. Coding isnt something anyone can expect to perfect in 6 months, and i expect this to be the first of many steps taken to that end. I would be happy with what I receive from this class if I'm able to get a job and support my family using the skills that I've developed. As I earlier stated, a dream would be to be able to program and release a game of my own, even if only on a small-scale app store.
